Abstract = {We ask whether neural networks can learn to use secret keys to protect information from other neural networks. Specifically, we focus on ensuring confidentiality properties in a multiagent system, and we specify those properties in terms of an adversary. Thus, a system may consist of neural networks named Alice and Bob, and we aim to limit what a third neural network named Eve learns from eavesdropping on the communication between Alice and Bob. We do not prescribe specific cryptographic algorithms to these neural networks; instead, we train end-to-end, adversarially. We demonstrate that the neural networks can learn how to perform forms of encryption and decryption, and also how to apply these operations selectively in order to meet confidentiality goals.},

@article{Genetic_Key_Guided_Neural_Deep_Learning_based_Encryption,
	Abstract = {In this paper, a neural deep learning guided genetic secret key based technique for encryption (GKNDLE) has been proposed for online transmission of data/information through wireless communication. In this approach both the communicating networks receive an indistinguishable input vector, produce an output bit and are trained based on the output bit. Synchronized weight vectors become the chromosome of the 1st generation Genetic Algorithm based secret key used to encrypt the plain text. Intermediate encrypted stream goes through another triangular cipher process. A secret key is also fabricated in the process of encryption as cascaded manner. This intermediate cipher text is again encrypted to form the final cipher text through chaining and cascaded xoring of identical weight vector with the identical length intermediate cipher text block. If size of the last block of intermediate cipher text is less than the size of the key then this block is kept unchanged. Receiver will use identical weight vector for performing deciphering process for getting the triangular encrypted cipher text and secret key for decoding. Finally GA secret key helps to generate ultimate plain text. A session key based transmission has also been proposed using 161-bit key format of 14 different segments [7,8]. Parametric tests are done and results are compared in terms of Chi-Square test, response time in transmission with some existing classical techniques, which shows comparable results for the proposed system},

@article{DESIGN_OF_AN_EFFICIENT_NEURAL_KEY_GENERATION,
	Abstract = {The goal of any cryptographic system is the exchange of information among the intended users without any leakage of information to others who may have unauthorized access to it. A common secret key could be created over a public channel accessible to any opponent. Neural networks can be used to generate common secret key. In case of neural cryptography, both the communicating networks receive an identical input vector, generate an output bit and are trained based on the output bit. The two networks and their weight vectors exhibit a novel phenomenon, where the networks synchronize to a state with identical time-dependent weights. The generated secret key over a public channel is used for encrypting and decrypting the information being sent on the channel.},

@article{BIG_ResearchPaper,
	Abstract = {Neural networks can synchronize by learning from each other. In the case of discrete weights full synchronization is achieved in a finite number of steps. Additional networks can be trained by using the inputs and outputs generated during this process as examples. Several learning rules for both tasks are presented and analyzed. In the case of Tree Parity Machines synchronization is much faster than learning. Scaling laws for the number of steps needed for full synchronization and successful learning are derived using analytical models. They indicate that the difference between both processes can be controlled by changing the synaptic depth. In the case of bidirectional interaction the synchronization time increases proportional to the square of this parameter, but it grows exponentially, if information is transmitted in one direction only. Because of this effect neural synchronization can be used to construct a cryptographic key-exchange protocol. Here the partners benefit from mutual interaction, so that a passive attacker is usually unable to learn the generated key in time. The success probabilities of different attack methods are determined by numerical simulations and scaling laws are derived from the data. They show that the partners can reach any desired level of security by just increasing the synaptic depth. Then the complexity of a successful attack grows exponentially, but there is only a polynomial increase of the effort needed to generate a key. Further improvements of security are possible by replacing the random inputs with queries generated by the partners.},
